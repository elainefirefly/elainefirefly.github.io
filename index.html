      <p><strong>I am a ninja.</strong> <em>Ssshhhhh!</em></p>
      <p>My weapon of choice? The shuriken. It goes without saying, "throw it out there,
        and see what sticks."  Well, in this case -- <em>slices</em>. It also sounds like,
        <strong>"Sure, I can!"</strong>  So, why not?</p>

      <p>My shurikens come in many makeshift forms: some blunt, some scrappy, some bloody,
        some even falls apart -- but it shall get better in time. This tiny, but magical
        piece of the world wide web is my tribute to my shurikens -- the concept, inspiration,
        and the story behind each one.</p>
      <p>You might have guessed by now<em>(or not)</em>, that my shurikens are my coding projects.
        Here are some of my shurikens that I worked with in the past:</p>
