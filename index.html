    <h1>Shuriken Diary</h1>
    <h2>Taking a stab at it - three shurikens at a time.</h2>
    <p><strong>I am a ninja.</strong> <em>Ssshhhhh!</em></p>
    <p>My weapon of choice? The shuriken. It goes without saying, "throw it out there,
      and see what sticks."  Well, in this case -- <em>slices</em>. It also sounds like,
      <strong>"Sure, I can!"</strong>  So, why not?</p>

    <p><img src="images/me_and_clumsy_ninja.jpg" alt="Clumsy me..." style="float:right;width:280px">
      My shurikens come in many makeshift forms: some blunt, some scrappy, some bloody,
      some even falls apart -- but it shall get better in time. This tiny, but magical
      piece of the world wide web is my tribute to my shurikens -- the concept, inspiration,
      and the story behind each one.</p>
    <p>Oh and guess what, <strong>you might be a ninja</strong>, too!</p>
