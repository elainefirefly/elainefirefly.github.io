      <p><strong>I am a ninja.</strong> <em>Ssshhhhh!</em></p>
      <p>My weapon of choice? The shuriken. It goes without saying, "throw it out there,
        and see what sticks."  Well, in this case – <em>slices</em>. It also sounds like,
        <strong>"Sure, I can!"</strong>  So, why not?</p>

      <p>My shurikens come in many makeshift forms: some blunt, some scrappy, some bloody,
        some even falls apart – but it shall get better in time. This tiny, but magical
        piece of the world wide web is my tribute to my shurikens – the concept, inspiration,
        and the story behind each one.</p>
      <p>You might have guessed by now<em>(or not)</em>, that my shurikens are my coding projects.
        Here are some of my shurikens that I worked with in the past:
        <ul>
          <li><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/uprompti/id822767958?mt=8">Uprompti</a></li>
          <li><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/divvy-up!/id603375269?mt=8">Divvy Up!</a></li>
        </ul>

        If you click on the project link, it will take you to the iTunes Preview website.</p>
      <p>The iTunes Preview website source code is good, as expected. It looks like it is pulling the data
        from somewhere else, making the content dynamic.  Majority are javascript codes and style
        sheets which produces the layout of the images and data. (Response to Release 1 #4)</p>
